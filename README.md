# Health Analysis Report 
## Project Objective 
The objective of this project is to analyze health data to identify key factors contributing to heart disease. By examining demographics, lifestyle habits, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, BMI, stress, and sleep patterns, the goal is to uncover risk trends, support early detection, and provide insights for preventive healthcare strategies.

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the overall percentage of heart disease cases in the population?

- How many individuals fall into the high-risk category?

- What are the average cholesterol levels across age groups and genders?

- How does stress and sleep impact the likelihood of heart disease?

- What is the average BMI of individuals with and without heart disease?

- How do blood pressure trends vary by age group and gender?

- What percentage of smokers vs. non-smokers are affected by heart disease?

- How does alcohol consumption relate to heart disease cases?

- What is the distribution of blood pressure levels (normal, elevated, high)?

- How do triglyceride levels in high LDL patients differ across groups?

  ## Process

  - Data Collection – Gather patient health records including demographics, cholesterol, triglycerides, BMI, blood pressure, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, sleep), and medical history.

- Data Cleaning & Preparation – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize metrics (age groups, gender, stress levels, etc.).

- Data Exploration (EDA) – Perform descriptive statistics and visualize distributions of health indicators.

- KPI Definition – Identify key metrics such as heart disease percentage, high-risk count, average BMI, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle impacts.

- Data Analysis – Apply statistical and analytical methods to discover correlations between risk factors and heart disease.

- Visualization & Dashboarding – Build interactive dashboards to present trends, patterns, and comparisons (age, gender, lifestyle).

- Insights & Reporting – Summarize findings, highlight major risks, and recommend preventive healthcare strategies.

## Project Insights:
The analysis revealed that 19.37% of individuals are affected by heart disease, with a high-risk group of 5K. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, and reduced sleep were strongly linked to higher risk. Average BMI (29) and cholesterol levels remained consistent across groups, but patients with high LDL showed elevated triglycerides. Blood pressure was a major risk indicator, with a large proportion showing elevated or high BP, and age trends indicated that heart disease prevalence varied across groups.

## Final Conclusion:
The study highlights that while genetic and demographic factors play a role, lifestyle habits and key health metrics (BP, cholesterol, triglycerides, sleep) significantly influence heart disease risk. By focusing on preventive measures such as healthy lifestyle adoption, stress management, and regular monitoring of vital metrics, overall heart disease cases can be reduced and high-risk individuals better managed.
